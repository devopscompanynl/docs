---

## Welcome

The DocOpsAI API powers an AI-based order processing application that extracts information from email attachments and forwards it to backend systems. It provides endpoints for order management, customer and product CRUD, email watching, and template parameter configuration.

The API reference is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/devopscompanynl/docs/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.json).

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://customer.aiotic.ai
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints (except `/healthcheck`) require an API key passed via the `X-API-Key` header. Customer and product endpoints also accept a customer-specific API key.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "ApiKeyAuth": []
  }
]
```
